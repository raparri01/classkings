# Classkings (No Longer Hosted)
*March 2017 - March 2018*

**Intoduction**
Classkings is a course lookup website hobby project by Robert Aparri.

This app was built to offer Manhattan College an alternative to the provided course lookup service. Classkings uses Algolia search on a re-created version of the course database to enable users to search multiple categories and fields with a single search bar. Classkings also provides filters to the search results to help users find the courses they are looking for ten times faster than the default course search website.
